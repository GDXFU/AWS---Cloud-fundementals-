# AWS---Cloud-fundementals-
Hands-on labs with IAM, EC2, and S3


## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with AWS cloud services, focusing on security, access control, and infrastructure management. The goal of this lab was to practice configuring secure AWS environments using IAM, EC2, S3, and RDS.

## Technologies Used:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- Linux / Ubuntu
- AWS Management Console

## Objectives
- Apply least privilege access using IAM policies
- Launch and configure EC2 instances securely
- Manage S3 storage with controlled permissions
- Configure and secure RDS databases
- Understand cloud security best practices

## Key Tasks Completed

### IAM Security Configuration
- Created custom IAM users and roles
- Applied least privilege policies
- Tested read-only vs restricted permissions
- Verified access controls and denied actions

### EC2 Instance Setup
- Launched Linux EC2 instance
- Configured security groups
- Restricted inbound network access
- Connected via SSH securely

### S3 Storage Management
- Created and configured S3 buckets
- Applied permission policies
- Tested file upload and access restrictions

### RDS Database Security
- Created RDS database instance
- Disabled public access
- Restricted security group rules
- Verified database protection settings

## Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Least privilege principle
- Identity and access management
- Network security groups
- Cloud resource protection
- Access verification and auditing

## What I Learned
Through this lab, I gained practical experience in securing AWS cloud resources, managing user permissions, and applying industry-standard security practices. This project strengthened my understanding of cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## Future Improvements
- Implement automated security monitoring
- Explore AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch
- Add infrastructure as code (Terraform or CloudFormation)
